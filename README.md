# Basic-to-Advanced-AI-Road
Educational Repo with the goal to cover gaps between Data science and AI
# ðŸš€ From Data Scientist to AI Practitioner

This repo documents my journey to transition from a **Data Scientist** into a full-fledged **AI Practitioner**.  
The roadmap is structured into **phases** and **layers of knowledge**:  

- **Must Know** â†’ Essential foundations (baseline skills).  
- **Should Know** â†’ Core AI practitioner skills (industry-ready).  
- **Good to Know** â†’ Advanced/edge knowledge (specialization, research-level).  

Along the way, Iâ€™ll build **mini-projects** and **capstone projects**, with all code, notes, and datasets linked here.
